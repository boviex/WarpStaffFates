# WarpStaffFates
 Warp Staff in FE14

Intended for use with Magikoopa.

This expands code.bin so any ips patches you have will crash Citra. Convert them to bps patches or just patch them directly to code.bin first.

Assumes that a copy of the Rescue staff with the IID "IID_Warp" exists with range set to 1-1 (so that only adjacent allies can be warped.)
